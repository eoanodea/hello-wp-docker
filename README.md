# 👋🏻 Hello WP Docker

A nice little boilerplate to quickly get a full WordPress stack running in docker. Files in the `wp-content` folder are synced between your local machine and the docker container.

### How to run it?
1. Make sure you have [docker installed and running](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Run `docker compose up -d`
3. Open up http://localhost:8000
